# v1.10.0 - 2026-05-20 - Three Step

> **Three Step** — redesigns the booking widget from a slot-picker-first flow to a clean 3-step form: enter your info, pick your service and barber, then choose an available time. Services and barbers are loaded live from the API. Slots show 12-hour AM/PM time. Dark theme color scheme updated to gold labels and warm cream text.

## What's Changed

### Added
- Booking widget 3-step flow: (1) Full name / phone / email, (2) service dropdown + preferred barber dropdown (live from API), (3) available time slots + notes textarea
- `/catalog/options?locationId=X` API endpoint integration — services and barbers fetched dynamically
- 12-hour AM/PM time format on the slot grid

### Changed
- Dark theme color scheme: gold labels (`#f5b544`), warm cream text (`#f0ede4`), gold-tinted input borders
- Widget CSS overrides moved to end of `booking-widget.css` so cascade order is correct
- `index.html` style block: `#booking-widget { padding: 0 }`, `.bw-root { border: none }`, `select`/`option` dark theme styling

### Fixed
- Step indicator misalignment: `line-height: 1` + `align-self: center` correct Space Grotesk font offset in dot circles

# v1.9.9 - 2026-05-19 - Dev API URL

> **Dev API URL** — reverts `data-api-url` to `http://localhost:3000` for local dev. The previous release incorrectly set it to the unreachable VPS address, breaking the widget locally.

## What's Changed

### Fixed
- `index.html` — `data-api-url` reverted from `http://74.208.9.49:3001` to `http://localhost:3000`

# v1.9.8 - 2026-05-19 - Widget Render

> **Widget Render** — fixes the booking widget crashing silently in the browser due to `process.env.NODE_ENV` shipping as a live runtime reference in the UMD bundle. Rebuilt the bundle with the value inlined at build time, added a visible offline fallback, and applied dark-theme CSS overrides so the widget is readable on the site's dark surface.

## What's Changed

### Fixed
- `assets/booking-widget.js` — rebuilt with `process.env.NODE_ENV` replaced at build time; widget no longer throws `ReferenceError: process is not defined`; bundle size reduced from 483 kB to 154 kB
- `assets/booking-widget.css` — rebuilt from latest source; dark-theme overrides prepended for `#12121e` surface
- `index.html` — `data-api-url` restored to `http://74.208.9.49:3001`; seed IDs updated

### Added
- `index.html` — `.bw-fallback`: shows phone CTA when booking API is unreachable

> **Fix Widget Reveal** — patch removing the `data-reveal` attribute from the booking widget container, which was preventing the widget from rendering on page load.

  - 9 Low findings (favicon, Twitter Cards, canonical URL, robots.txt, sitemap, cursor RAF loop, lightbox issues)
  - `prefers-reduced-motion` confirmed absent — promoted from Unverified to Medium

---

# v1.7.2 - 2026-05-04 - True Line

> **True Line** — precision patch. Corrects the optical centering of text inside the Book Now nav button by applying asymmetric horizontal padding, pulling the text left to achieve true visual center inside the pill.

## What's Changed

### Fixed
- `.btn-primary` — applied asymmetric horizontal padding (`right: 1.8rem / left: 1.2rem`) to compensate for the optical right-shift of uppercase text inside the pill button, achieving visual dead-center alignment

---

# v1.7.1 - 2026-05-04 - Lined Up

> **Lined Up** — precision patch. Corrects two visual issues with the Book Now button in the fixed navigation bar: button position in the header layout and text centering inside the pill.

## What's Changed

### Fixed
- `.header-inner` — switched from `flex` + `justify-content: space-between` to a 3-column CSS grid (`auto 1fr auto`) so the nav anchors to the center column and the CTA sits right-aligned without excessive gap ([`0894640`](../../commit/0894640))
- `.header-inner nav` — added `display: flex; justify-content: center` so nav links sit centered in the grid's middle column ([`0894640`](../../commit/0894640))
- `.nav-cta` — reduced `gap` from `1rem` to `0.75rem` to tighten the walk-in label and button grouping ([`77cf282`](../../commit/77cf282))
- `.btn-primary` — reduced `letter-spacing` from `0.16em` → `0.06em` → `0` to eliminate the invisible trailing-space offset that made button text appear left-shifted inside the pill ([`98aec0f`](../../commit/98aec0f))

# v1.1.0 - 2026-05-03 - Marquee

## What's Changed

### Renamed
- `Jones Barbor Shop.html` → `index.html` — removes spaces from the filename that break URL encoding on most servers, fixes the `"Barbor"` typo in the filename, and makes the site the default document served by GitHub Pages, Netlify, Apache, and nginx

> No content was changed. Markup, styles, and JavaScript are identical.
